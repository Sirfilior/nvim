  If you don't know anything about Lua, I recommend taking some time to read through
  a guide. One possible example:
  - https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/

  And then you can explore or search through `:help lua-guide`

Kickstart Guide:

I have left several `:help X` comments throughout the init.lua
You should run that command and read that help section for more information.

-- Set <space> as the leader key
-- See `:help mapleader`
--  NOTE: Must happen before plugins are required (otherwise wrong leader will be used)

vim.g.maplocalleader = " "

require("custom")

-- Install package manager

-- NOTE: Here is where you install your plugins.
--  You can configure plugins using the `config` key.
--
--  You can also configure plugins after the setup call,
--    as they will be available in your neovim runtime.
require("lazy").setup({

	-- NOTE: This is where your plugins related to LSP can be installed.
	--  The configuration is done below. Search for lspconfig to find it below.

		dependencies = {
			-- Automatically install LSPs to stdpath for neovim
			{ "williamboman/mason.nvim", config = true },
			"williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim",

			-- Useful status updates for LSP
			-- NOTE: `opts = {}` is the same as calling `require('fidget').setup({})`
			{ "j-hui/fidget.nvim", tag = "legacy", opts = {} },

			-- Additional lua configuration, makes nvim stuff amazing!

	-- NOTE: Next Step on Your Neovim Journey: Add/Configure additional "plugins" for kickstart
	--       These are some example plugins that I've included in the kickstart repository.
	--       Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them.
	require("kickstart.plugins.autoformat"),
	require("kickstart.plugins.debug"),

	-- NOTE: The import below automatically adds your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
	--    You can use this folder to prevent any conflicts with this init.lua if you're interested in keeping
	--    up-to-date with whatever is in the kickstart repo.
	--
	--    For additional information see: https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim#-structuring-your-plugins
	{ import = "custom.plugins" },

	-- NOTE: This can be used to override plugin setups and disable
	{ import = "scrap.vscode" },
